Summary:

DoodlePad is an easy to use, unique sketching application for Windows Phone 7.  It allows you to create sketches using a streamlined brush and custom color tool. You can take a picture with your friends and add some funny captions. Then when you are finished with your new masterpiece you can save it to your phone's Photo Hub. 

DoodlePad is also a great way to entertain your little ones and show off their artwork.

About Dave:

I want to thank Microsoft for their generous moonlighting clause around Windows Phone development.  Thanks to that clause I own all the rights to the DoodlePad code under the company name DaveDev Productions.  I am releasing the code (and included design files) back to the community for free under the Apache 2.0 License.  If you want to thank me you can include a link to my twitter (http://twitter.com/thedavedev) in your code or app credits.
